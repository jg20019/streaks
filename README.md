# Streaks

A simple project for keeping track of how much consistenly I work on projects. 
Right now it only supports one project, but it is simple enough to be useful
for that purpose. 

The idea is that seeing all of the progress made at a glance is motivating. 
Being able to see all of the days that I worked on something keeps me 
motivate to keep working on those things. I want to build the habit of
working consistently. 

This is one of several projects inspired by this youtube
video - [The Habits of Effective Artists by Andrew Price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM39qhXle4g)

There are several additions that need to be made such as:
[ ] Saving to a database instead of just to local storage
[ ] Adding support for mutliple projects
[ ] Preventing users from marking dates in the future
[ ] Viewing a year at a glance 
[ ] Keeping track of the current streak
